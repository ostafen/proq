# proq

**proq** is an open-source command-line tool that acts as an embedded in-memory Prometheus server. It allows you to pull metrics from any given endpoint that exposes Prometheus metrics and visualize them as plots and histograms directly in the terminal, powered by [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui). This is especially useful for debugging inside a server or container where setting up a full Prometheus instance is impractical. With `proq`, you can quickly inspect metrics without any external dependencies.

## Features
- 🚀 Pulls and stores Prometheus metrics in memory
- 📊 Displays real-time plots and histograms in the terminal
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast
- 🎛️ Simple CLI interface for querying and visualization

### Manual Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proq.git

```

## Usage

### Start the embedded server and pull metrics
```sh
proq --endpoint http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### View available metrics
```sh
proq list

### Plot a specific metric
```sh
proq plot http_requests_total
```

### Show a histogram of a metric
```sh
proq hist response_time_seconds
```
